# twitter_sentiment_analysis_approach

it may had performed well on test data if i had used more epochs while training, used Recurrent Neural Neural or stack of Recurrent Neural Networks with
dropouts and regularization.

there is a lot of gap between training and validations loss and acuuracy, this is because i used pretrained word embedding GLOVE which knows the 
relations between sentiments.

this is performed on a normal pc, no gpu is been used, therefore you can analyse the amount of time i had to spent while visualizing my approach
and efficiency.
